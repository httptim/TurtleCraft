# Phase 2 Summary: ME Bridge Integration

## Overview
Successfully completed Phase 2 of the TurtleCraft distributed crafting system. The system now has full ME Bridge integration, allowing the Jobs Computer to interact with Applied Energistics 2 ME networks.

## Completed Features

### 1. ME Bridge Library (`lib/me_bridge.lua`)
- **Connection Management**: Auto-detection and manual configuration support
- **Item Operations**: List, search, get item details
- **Transfer Operations**: Export/import items to/from ME system
- **Crafting Support**: Check craftable items, initiate crafting
- **Storage Monitoring**: Track storage usage and capacity
- **Energy Monitoring**: Monitor ME system energy levels
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging

### 2. Jobs Computer ME Integration
- **ME Status Display**: Shows connection status, item count, and storage usage
- **Interactive Commands**:
  - `I` - Show ME items (displays first 15 items)
  - `S` - Search items by name
- **Item Transfer API**: Handles turtle requests for items
  - `REQUEST_ITEMS` - Export items from ME to turtle
  - `DEPOSIT_ITEMS` - Import items from turtle to ME
  - `CHECK_STOCK` - Check stock levels of specific items
- **Periodic Updates**: ME status refreshes every 30 seconds

### 3. Turtle ME Integration
- **New Commands**:
  - `G` - Get items from ME system (interactive prompt)
  - `D` - Deposit items to ME system (shows inventory, select slot)
- **Network Messages**: Properly formatted requests/responses
- **Error Handling**: Timeout handling and error display

### 4. Main Computer Updates
- **ME Status Display**: Shows ME connection status and item count
- **Status Synchronization**: Receives ME status from Jobs Computer

### 5. Testing Tools
- **`test_me_bridge.lua`**: Comprehensive ME Bridge testing script
  - Tests connection, storage info, energy info
  - Lists items, searches items, shows craftables
  - Tests item export/import functionality
  - Displays crafting CPU status

## Technical Implementation

### Network Protocol Extensions
```lua
-- New message types for ME operations
REQUEST_ITEMS    -- Turtle -> Jobs: Request items from ME
ITEMS_RESPONSE   -- Jobs -> Turtle: Response with items
DEPOSIT_ITEMS    -- Turtle -> Jobs: Deposit items to ME
DEPOSIT_RESPONSE -- Jobs -> Turtle: Deposit confirmation
CHECK_STOCK      -- Turtle -> Jobs: Check item stock
STOCK_RESPONSE   -- Jobs -> Turtle: Stock level response
```

### ME Bridge API Usage
- Uses Advanced Peripherals ME Bridge peripheral
- Supports both auto-detection (`peripheral.find`) and manual configuration
- Handles all major ME operations through a clean API

### Item Transfer Flow
1. **Turtle requests items** → Jobs Computer receives request
2. **Jobs Computer exports from ME** → Items appear in container
3. **Turtle picks up items** → Confirmation sent back
4. **Reverse flow for deposits** → Items go from turtle to ME

## Testing Instructions

### Setup Requirements
1. Install Advanced Peripherals mod
2. Place ME Bridge connected to Jobs Computer
3. Connect ME Bridge to ME network with power
4. Place container (chest) adjacent to ME Bridge for item transfers

### Testing Steps
1. **Start Jobs Computer** - Should show "ME System: CONNECTED"
2. **Run `test_me_bridge`** - Comprehensive ME Bridge test
3. **Press `I` in Jobs Computer** - View ME items
4. **Press `S` in Jobs Computer** - Search for items
5. **On Turtle, press `G`** - Request items from ME
6. **On Turtle, press `D`** - Deposit items to ME

## Known Limitations

1. **Item Transfer Direction**: Currently assumes turtle is above ME Bridge
2. **Bulk Operations**: No batch operations yet (one item type at a time)
3. **Crafting Integration**: ME crafting not integrated with job system yet
4. **Storage Monitoring**: Basic monitoring only, no alerts

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

Based on the development roadmap, Phase 3 will focus on:
1. **Recipe System** - Define crafting recipes
2. **Dependency Resolution** - Calculate required materials
3. **Priority System** - Handle crafting priorities
4. **Recipe Validation** - Ensure recipes are valid

## File Size Update

Current file sizes:
- `lib/me_bridge.lua`: ~8KB
- `jobs_computer.lua`: ~14KB (increased from ~10KB)
- `turtle.lua`: ~11KB (increased from ~8KB)
- `test_me_bridge.lua`: ~5KB

Total project size still well within 1MB limit per computer.

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully adds ME Bridge integration to the TurtleCraft system. The Jobs Computer can now interact with ME storage, turtles can request and deposit items, and the system provides good visibility into ME status. The foundation is ready for Phase 3's recipe and crafting system.
