#### 8. Installer (`installer.lua`)
- **Size**: ~13KB (not deployed to computers)
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful UI with progress bars
  - Downloads all files from GitHub
  - Creates required directories
  - Generates launcher scripts
  - Computer type selection after install

### Total Sizes (Phase 1)
- **Main Computer**: ~41KB (target: 150KB ✓)
- **Jobs Computer**: ~59KB (target: 150KB ✓)
- **Turtle**: ~40KB (target: 60KB ✓)

### Key Achievements

1. **Auto-Detection System**: Eliminates manual peripheral configuration
2. **Robust Networking**: Reliable communication with timeouts and retries
3. **Professional Logging**: Debug capabilities without cluttering the UI
4. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across libraries
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with informative messages
6. **Size Efficiency**: Well under the 1MB limit per computer

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Config template with all settings
- [x] Peripheral auto-detection works
- [x] Network protocol established
- [x] Logging captures events
- [x] Main Computer connects to Jobs Computer
- [x] Turtles register successfully
- [x] Heartbeats maintain connections
- [x] Status updates propagate
- [x] Clean shutdown procedures
- [x] Installer deploys all files

### What's NOT Included (Coming in Later Phases)

- ME Bridge item operations (Phase 2)
- Recipe system and dependencies (Phase 3)
- Job queue and distribution (Phase 4)
- GUI interfaces (Phase 5-6)
- Monitor displays (Phase 7)
- Advanced features (Phase 8)

### Usage Instructions

1. **Installation**:
   ```
   wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/httptim/TurtleCraft/main/installer.lua
   ```

2. **Start Order**:
   - Start Jobs Computer first: `start-jobs`
   - Start Main Computer second: `start-main`
   - Start Turtles last: `start-turtle`

3. **Verification**:
   - Jobs Computer shows "Jobs Computer ready"
   - Main Computer shows "ONLINE" connection
   - Turtles appear in the turtle count

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Three-Computer Design**: Separates concerns and allows scaling
2. **Jobs Computer as Hub**: All operations flow through central manager
3. **Rednet for Control**: Reliable message passing with protocols
4. **Wired for Items**: Direct connections for item transfers
5. **Config Templates**: Reusable settings with auto-detection

### Code Quality

- Consistent error handling with pcall
- Comprehensive logging throughout
- Clear function and variable names
- Modular design with focused libraries
- Comments explain complex logic

### Next Steps

Phase 2 will add:
- ME Bridge interface module
- Item listing and searching
- Export/import operations
- Stock level monitoring
- Basic resource management

The foundation is solid and ready for building the advanced features!
