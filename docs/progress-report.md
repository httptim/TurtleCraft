# TurtleCraft Progress Report

## Summary
Successfully created a working network implementation for the distributed crafting system. The core networking issues have been resolved, and all three components (Jobs Computer, Main Computer, and Turtles) can now communicate reliably.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Network Issues Resolved
**Problem**: The original implementation had complex peripheral detection and network discovery that wasn't working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified to use rednet properly according to CC:Tweaked documentation
- Jobs Computer hosts itself with `rednet.host(protocol, "jobs")`
- Other computers find it with `rednet.lookup(protocol, "jobs")`
- No hardcoded computer IDs required

### 2. Event Handling
**Problem**: Original code used `os.pullEvent(timeout)` which doesn't exist in CC:Tweaked.

**Solution**: 
- Use timers for non-blocking event loops
- Proper event handling pattern:
```lua
local timer = os.startTimer(0.1)
local event, p1, p2 = os.pullEvent()
if event == "timer" and p1 == timer then
    -- timeout
else
    os.cancelTimer(timer)
    -- handle other events
end
```

### 3. Turtle Management
**Problem**: Broken turtles remained in the Jobs Computer list indefinitely.

**Solution**: 
- Heartbeat system with configurable timeouts
- Three states: online → offline (60s) → removed (180s)
- Graceful shutdown with UNREGISTER message
- Main Computer shows active/total turtle count

## What Works Now

### ✅ Core Networking
- Reliable computer discovery using rednet protocols
- No hardcoded IDs needed (Jobs Computer can be any ID)
- Debug mode shows all network traffic
- Network test tool for troubleshooting

### ✅ Jobs Computer
- Hosts itself on network as "jobs"
- Tracks registered turtles with heartbeats
- Automatically removes offline turtles
- Shows turtle status (online/offline with time)
- Responds to status requests

### ✅ Main Computer  
- Automatically finds Jobs Computer on network
- Shows connection status
- Displays active/total turtle count
- Updates every 5 seconds
- Reconnect command (R key)

### ✅ Turtle Client
- Registers with Jobs Computer
- Sends heartbeats every 30 seconds
- Graceful shutdown/unregister
- Re-registration command (R key)
- Fuel level display and refuel command (F key)

### ✅ Installation & Setup
- Updated installer with new file list
- Startup menu for easy program selection
- Network test tool included
- Clear setup instructions

## Current Limitations

1. **No ME Bridge Integration** - Jobs Computer doesn't interact with ME system yet
2. **No Job Queue** - Can't actually assign crafting jobs
3. **No Recipe System** - No recipe definitions or crafting logic
4. **No Persistence** - Turtle list is lost on Jobs Computer restart
5. **Basic Text UI** - No fancy graphics or monitors

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

### Phase 2: ME Bridge Integration
1. Create `lib/me_bridge.lua` for ME system interaction
2. Add item listing and searching
3. Implement item export/import to turtles
4. Add stock level monitoring

### Phase 3: Job System
1. Create job queue data structure
2. Add job assignment logic
3. Implement job status tracking
4. Add job completion/failure handling

### Phase 4: Recipe System
1. Create recipe configuration format
2. Add recipe validation
3. Implement crafting logic in turtles
4. Add dependency checking

### Phase 5: Persistence
1. Save turtle registry to file
2. Save job queue state
3. Restore on startup
4. Handle partial state recovery

### Phase 6: Enhanced UI
1. Better status displays
2. Job queue visualization
3. Progress indicators
4. Monitor support

## Technical Details

### File Structure (Simplified)
```
/
├── config.lua           # Configuration (protocol, timeouts)
├── lib/
│   └── network.lua      # Network library (rednet wrapper)
├── jobs_computer.lua    # Central manager
├── main_computer.lua    # User interface
├── turtle.lua           # Turtle client
├── startup.lua          # Menu selector
└── test_network.lua     # Network diagnostic tool
```

### Network Protocol
- Protocol name: "turtlecraft"
- Service discovery: Jobs Computer hosts as "jobs"
- Message format: `{type, data, sender, time}`
- Message types: PING/PONG, REGISTER, HEARTBEAT, STATUS_REQUEST, UNREGISTER

### Configuration Options
```lua
PROTOCOL = "turtlecraft"          -- Network protocol name
NETWORK_TIMEOUT = 5               -- Network operation timeout
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30           -- Turtle heartbeat frequency
TURTLE_OFFLINE_TIMEOUT = 60       -- Mark offline after 1 minute
TURTLE_REMOVE_TIMEOUT = 180       -- Remove from list after 3 minutes
DEBUG = true                      -- Show network messages
```

## Conclusion

The foundation is now solid. The network layer works reliably, computers can find each other automatically, and the system properly handles disconnections. This provides a stable base for adding the actual crafting functionality in subsequent phases.

The key insight was to simplify and follow CC:Tweaked's rednet documentation exactly, rather than trying to build a complex custom protocol on top of it. The built-in service discovery via `rednet.host()` and `rednet.lookup()` handles the computer discovery problem elegantly.
